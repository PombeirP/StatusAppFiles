# StatusAppFiles

This archive contains all files that are required to create desktop mac bundle of `StatusIm`.
When Jenkins builds desktop for mac it downloads zip, unpacks it and adds freshly built binaries to create `StatusIm.dmg` in the end.

Originally StatusIm.zip was stored in the google drive but moved to github because of difficulties with downloading google drive documents from command line.
